		<text value="If EPG-Backup is enabled, the EPG-File generated by Enigma will be backuped.\n Normally Enigma keeps the EPG in memory and write the file after shutting down the GUI. If there was a Softwarecrash (Green-Screen) the EPG-Informations are lost.\n The Backup-Functionality take the last or biggest Backup-File and copy it to the Enigma-EPG-File before starting the GUI.\n\n Technical Informations:\nEPG-Backup comes with an 'Boot-Loop-Protection'. If enigma crashes because of invalid EPG-Data, normaly the EPG-File will not be there on next boot, so there won't be a bootloop. So EPG-Backup counts unsuccesfully boots and won't be restore a backupfile if the counter reaches a configurable value."/>
